Sun Gods crest upon his azure shield Shows you what you know ain’t what you feel Shooting beam, blinding me The sun is a giant spaceship tangerine It shoots out rays of hopeful golden morphine Tangerine shooting beam Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Tangerine shooting beam As I stand before this holy sphere It’s singing me a song I don’t want to hear Want to hear Uh huh, yeah, yeah, woah All I see is warm champagne Confetti on the floor from last night, still laying The same playlist on my phone, still playing as my eyes strain Jealous of the sun, wishing I could do the same Man, but how I’m supposed rise though when shit just hold me down? How I'm supposed to shine man, through all the smoke and clouds? I’m on a trip, no luggage, no ticket I’m looking in the mirror and I’m the only thing missing I been tryna find myself, I feel so long distance Made a promise to myself, I wouldn't just be a statistic No, no, I’m the one of the one on one’s Twenty some but my soul a hundred some My mind’s racing, it’s racing And honestly I can’t remember what it’s running from I just hope that I come in one Seems like everyone I know is getting married Everyone else getting buried Life should come with a sign saying "results may vary” Straight up I take my place along the memory The sun’s so high, it’s rising in the heat Try to fight the sunrise but it comes for you Love is brighter than the fiery violent truth	0
The first impulse to violence is probably right The second impulse to stop it is probably wrong Why do people only show forgiveness when they want to sound cool in a song? So I keep tryin' to understand where we are goin' I keep searchin' for some meanin' in my dreams And I'm dreamin' of bein' eaten by a tiger While the sparrows start to sing in a tree And we always end up singin' the same song They remind us of the cool shit in the world But they also remind us we are dying That's why we want to sing even more I don't think we got where we were goin' I had a dream that we were in a weird sky Why do people let their dreams be somethin' so bad? Such a weird fuckin' dream Flyin' around into the sky, like superman Changing tigers and your arrows land sparrows Those religious fucks will never understand And we always end up singin' the same song They remind us of the cool shit in the world Maybe it wasn't really a dream I can't really tell anymore And we always end up singin' the same song 'Cause we always end up singin' the same song Helps us to forget that we were wrong And we always end up singin' the same song And we always end up singin' the same song Helps us to forget that we were wrong	0
Eyes are strange They say everything While our mouths They just try to sing Singing something I can never fall forever and ever So I try to understand it all, but I fail to live it up I'm still standing here forever without sunshine in my mind Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar There's some kind of love that's so much higher Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar I've seen death, I’ve seen truth I've heard lies, I've seen birth too I've seen happiness, I've seen pain And I've seen the sun come up and I've kissed the moon I’ve heard voices through the wall I've seen figures in my bed I feel protected by things I don't understand And that's more than you could say Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar There's some kind of love that's so much higher Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar	0
We all walk around and waste life It's just gonna go on forever Like there's some eternal endless supply of what it takes to keep us alive There might be a day when everything goes away To remind us how ungrateful our culture is We need to take time to replace what's stolen from Mother Nature We only have sun, moon me, you And we only have a little time to show how much we love The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon) How much I really love you And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time) I once heard Grace Jones say I have my own concept of time I always think 'bout that 'cause I've always felt like I was running a little behind But what's in front of me?

How can I love someone I never touched? You lived under the water, but I love you so much You never been on land, and you never seen the sky You don't know what a cloud is Why does everything I love have to die? They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be But I couldn't let that be Thought keeping you small, meant keeping you safe If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea 'Cause I can't bear to see something so wild just die in a tank And Pablow the blowfish I miss you so much And Pablow the blowfish I miss you so bad On Saturday night, we all went out to eat But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi I got soup, and I ordered rice But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite Oh, Pablow the blowfish If they only knew you like I do They'd love you too And Pablow the blowfish I miss you so bad I won't forget, even one second we had 'Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead I heard of a seahorse named Sadie I heard she was quite the lady Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies That'd be kind of crazy If Pablow the blowfish Found love deep in the sea Then that would mean Pablow the blowfish Is better off than here with me But Pablow the blowfish I miss you so bad Damn	0

Here's something I've learned about people. We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip. This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you. The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'. When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right? Let me say it again, louder for those in the back... We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us. There will be no further explanation There will be just reputation.See ,	1

[Verse ] How long has it taken me to find you Five hundred years, five hundred thousand miles It don't matter now Love's always on time Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky  [Verse ] Lightning flashed, everything went silent A feather could have knocked me to the floor Missing piece was found I was finally alive Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky  [Bridge] With the speed of sound I'm homeward bound mhmm  [Verse ] All our sorrows swept away forever Each and every tear washed out to sea There ain't no goodbye With your hand in mine Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky Oklahoma sky Embed	8
Imagine a fighter with a centerfold face Comes from a long line of blue collars and lace With a grip like reigns to a steed and kisses for days And imagine a winner holding pink champagne Who stills loves her daddy but changes her name An overachiever, even she don't believe her own fame  You can't change her mind (Even if you wanted to) You can always try (She'll through you, she'll see through you) If you think she's the only one that she'll want in this world Then you don't know 'bout nothing about girls  Imagine you're best friend and you're worst enemy Begs you to stay and then wishes you'd leave Like Marilyn Monroe she can be who you want her to be  You can't change her mind (Even if you wanted to) You can always try (She'll through you, she'll see through you) If you think she's the only one that she'll want in this world Then you don't know 'bout nothing about girls  Go on, go on Give her everything and more Love her all you want She was never yours  You can't change her mind You can always try If you think you're the only one that she'll want in this world Then you don't know 'bout nothing about girls If you think you're the only one that she'll want in this world Then you don't know nothing Know nothing About girlsEmbed	8
My disposition permeates The room when I walk in the place I'm sorry! By calculation I'm way too much Pretentiously I bitch a buck But you bought it! I can't exceed my reputation A small town girl with compensation Exploitin' all my possibilities Well don't you know I'll blaze a trail But hell You can come with me  What doesn't kill you Only makes you blonder My heels and my hotel They just got taller Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably Looks as good on records As it does on me  Historically real men prefer The Marilyns with curls and curves And I've got it! Genetically or chemically As long as it contains some bleach I want it!  You don't need to be a fighter Honey, just go one shade lighter You'll acquire everything you want When your roots grow out And things go South Hey, go back to the salon!  What doesn't kill you Only makes you blonder My heels and my hotel They just got taller Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably Looks as good on records As it does on me What doesn't kill you Only makes you blonder My heels and my hotel They just got taller Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably Looks as good on records As it does on me  Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably Looks as good on records as it does on me Platinum Platinum Somethin' bout platinumEmbed	8

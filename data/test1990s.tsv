Did you really care? Did you care at all for me? A displaced little girl Wept years in silence And whispered wishes you'd materialize She pressed on night and day To keep on living And tried to many ways To keep her soul alive Did you really care Care enough for me? Did you really care? Did you care at all for me? If I'm not quite good enough Or somehow undeserving of A mother's love You could have had the decency To give me up Before you gave me life Don't you even care Just the slightest bit for me? 'Cause I really need to feel you cared Even once upon a time for me I need to believe, in my heart of heart of hearts, you care for me I need to understand Why you left me there so helplessly Don't you even care Care at all for me?

41	[Intro] Mm [Verse ] Once upon a time there was a girl In her early years she had to learn How to grow up living in a war that she called home Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face Every time my father's fist would put her in her place Hearing all the yelling, I would cry up in my room Hoping it would be over soon [Chorus] Bruises fade, Father, but the pain remains the same And I still remember how you kept me so afraid Strength is my mother for all the love she gave Every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday And I'm OK [Verse ] I often wonder why I carry all this guilt When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door The echo of a broken child screaming, "Please, no more" Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done? To you, it's just a memory, but for me, it still lives on [Chorus] Bruises fade, Father, but the pain remains the same And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid Strength is my mother for all the love she gave Every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday [Bridge] It's not so easy to forget All the marks you left along her neck When I was thrown against cold stairs And every day, I'm afraid to come home In fear of what I might see next [Chorus] Bruises fade, Father, but the pain remains the same (Same) And I still remember how you kept me so afraid Strength is my mother for all the love you gave Every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday And I'm OK I'm OKEmbed	1	1

Last night when my psyche's Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice You slowly dropped your eyelids When true love takes a grip, it leaves you without a choice And in response to what you whispered in my ear I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too The leader of the free world Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks He's got him sen a theme tune They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring And in response to what you whispered in my ear I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too In the daytime Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies Summat else to publicise I'm sure you've heard about enough You might also like So in response to what you whispered in my ear I'll be upfront, sometimes I fantasise about you tooEmbed	17

I'm sittin' in the railway station got a ticket for my destination On a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand Every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band Homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound Home where my thought's escaping home where the music's playing Home where my love was waitin' silently for me Now every day's an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines And each town looks the same to me for movies and the factories And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be Homeward bound... Tonight I'll sing my songs again I'll play the game and pretend But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity Like emptiness and harmony I need someone to comfort me Homeward bound...You might also likeEmbed	20
Where do I begin To tell the story of how great a love can be? The sweet love story that is older than the sea The simple truth about the love she brings to me Where do I start? With her first hello She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine There'd never be another love, another time She came into my life and made the living fine She fills my heart She fills my heart with very special things With angels' songs, with wild imaginings She fills my soul with so much love That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely With her along, who could be lonely? I reach for her hand, it's always there How long does it last? Can love be measured by the hours in a day? I have no answers now, but this much I can say I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away And she'll be there She'll be thereYou might also likeEmbed	20
The desert is a barren land A wilderness of rock and sand It cries aloud for the fall of the rain And ever sifting sea of dust That knows no mercy, shows no trust A sunbaked waste for a scorpion's domain The dunes they rise, the dunes they fall Marching forth to conquer all That have no mind to move out of their way The man who turns heart away From Jesus Christ the King Is as a desert His sand is made of faith in earthly things His hopes become mirages And his heart grows cold and cruel And when a man enthrones himself as King Then His master is a fool The desert can move into a garden filled with fruits The King of Peace can fall in a holy storm His sand can turn to clay for the potter’s hands to shape Yes the deserts of the heart can be transformed If you open your heart to the Lord You might also likeThe desert can move into a garden filled with fruits The King of Peace can call in a holy storm His sand can turn to clay for the potter's hands to shape Yes the deserts of the heart can be transformed If you open open your heart to the Lord Open your heart to the LordEmbed	20

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon A caravan and an empty kitchen Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds One heart goin' both directions One love and a couple of questions Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? (Ooh, ooh) Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, oohEmbed	26
I'm walking in their footsteps I'm singing their old songs Somebody blazed this trail I'm treadin' on I'm bent, but I'm not broken I'm stronger than I feel I'm made of flesh and bone Not made of steel I'm the keeper of the flame The teller of the story Keeper of the flame For the ones that came before me For the little pilot lights waiting to ignite Like fireflies in the rain Keeper of the flame I've been burned out to ashes Waiting for a wind To carry me and start a fire again Sometimes I'm just a flicker A candle in your eye But I swear to God I'll never let it die  I'm the keeper of the flame The teller of the story Keeper of the flame For the ones that came before me For the little pilot lights waiting to ignite Like fireflies in the rain Keeper of the flame When I'm drowning When I'm fighting When I'm screaming When I'm hiding When I'm losing When I'm winning I go back to The beginning Keeper of the flame The teller of the story Keeper of the flame I'm not doing it for the glory But for those little pilot lights waiting to ignite Like fireflies in the rain Keeper of the flame I'm the keeper of the flame Ooh, ooh I'm the keeper of the flame Ooh, oohEmbed	26

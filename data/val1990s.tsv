Do you know where you're going to? Do you like the things that life is showing you? Where are you going to? Do you know? Do you get what you're hoping for When you look behind you, there's no open door What are you hoping for? Do you know? Once we were standing still in time Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me Do you know where you're going to? Do you like the things that life is showing you? Where are you going to? Do you know? Now looking back on all we've planned We let so many dreams slip through our hands Why must we wait so long before we see (Before we see) How sad the answer to those questions can be? Do you know where you're going to? Do you like the things that life is showing you? Where are you going to? Do you know? Do you get what you're hoping for? When you look behind you, there's no open door What are you hoping for? Do you know, baby? Mmm, mmm Mmm, mmm, mmm Baby MmmEmbed	0

Two days past eighteen He was waitin' for the bus in his army greens Sat down in a booth in a cafe there Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair He's a little shy so she give him a smile And he said, "Would you mind sittin' down for a while And talkin' to me? I'm feelin' a little low" She said "I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go" So they went down and they sat on the pier He said "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care I got no one, to send a letter to Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?" I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy "Too young for him," they told her Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waitin' for the soldier to come back again Nevermore to be alone When the letter said, "A soldier's comin' home" You might also like So the letters came from an army camp In California then Vietnam And he told her of his heart, it might be love And all of the things he was so scared of He said, "When it's gettin' kinda rough over here I think of that day sittin' down on the pier And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while" I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy "Too young for him," they told her Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waitin' for the soldier to come back again Nevermore to be alone When the letter said, "A soldier's comin' home" One Friday night at a football game The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang A man said, "Folks, would you bow your heads For a list of local Vietnam dead?" Cryin' all alone under the stands Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band And one name read, and nobody really cared But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy "Too young for him," they told her Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waitin' for the soldier to come back again Nevermore to be alone When the letter said, "A soldier's comin'..."

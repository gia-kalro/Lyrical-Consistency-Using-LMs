Last night when my psyche's Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice You slowly dropped your eyelids When true love takes a grip, it leaves you without a choice And in response to what you whispered in my ear I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too The leader of the free world Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks He's got him sen a theme tune They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring And in response to what you whispered in my ear I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too In the daytime Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies Summat else to publicise I'm sure you've heard about enough You might also like So in response to what you whispered in my ear I'll be upfront, sometimes I fantasise about you tooEmbed	5

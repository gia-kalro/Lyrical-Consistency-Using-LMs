32	Prologue"These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours." I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December , . In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn... The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new? For the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before. I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no "riding off into the sunset," like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off. I've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive. I hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for. From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love... Love, .

Some blonde asked The wind must have blown him in But an old Dutchman offered him a drink What will it be, whisky, rum or gin? Sick him Fido, a redhead shouted Show him his way back to the street But the Great Dane just walked over and licked his hand And lay down at his feet He said if you spare me that drink, Dutchman I promise I'll tell you how That I came to be the helpless sight That stands before you now I used to be an artist Not one who sits and fiddle out on the curb But in my day and time My music was considered superb I wrote a song about a poor kid Raised down in New Orleans It didn't make the hall of fame But it bought us shrimp, rice and beans He kept at it until it made the big time Playing town after town Until he met a woman he fell in love with And it really turned his life around She had eyes like Cleopatra And a head of luxurious hair With the brilliance of her beauty None other could compare When she lifted her eyes to his Her lips would fall apart Each time she allowed him kiss her It near petrified his heart But when he ask her would she marry him He'd give her everything he had She turned and walked away And it nearly drove him mad He promised her a half a million And would even pay in advance If she would let him prove himself Or at least give him a chance And if he should go blind And had to use his hands to feel He would hire someone to do her work And prepare her every meal How could a man love a woman so much?

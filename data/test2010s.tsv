32	Prologue"These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours." I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December , . In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn... The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new? For the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before. I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no "riding off into the sunset," like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off. I've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive. I hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for. From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love... Love, .

220	Took a heartbreak off the coast of Maine, came up short and I tried again Then New York stole the heart right off my sleeve Fell asleep with a broken wheel and something kept me rolling still Both eyes closed, waiting for the American dream  Yeah, I’m runnin’ just as fast as my heart can Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness But I keep on runnin’, changing tires and changing plans I call it my pursuit of happiness  Found a song in Carolina, left a tip at every diner Always running late on Eastern time Put a hundred in the offering plate and wondered if those pearly gates Would open if I found the perfect rhyme  Yeah, I’m runnin’ just as fast as my heart can Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness But I keep on runnin’, changing tires and changing plans I call it my pursuit of happiness  It’s a stranger, it’s a dollar It’s my name on a big marquee It’s a million miles away And it’s right in front of me   Yeah, I keep on runnin’ just as fast as my heart can Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness But I keep on runnin’, changing tires and changing plans I call it my pursuit of happiness  Yeah, it’s all just my pursuit of happinessEmbed	8	1
221	On my highway the yellow lines Have disappeared from time to time And I've wound up on the wrong side of the road On my highway I've gone too fast Afraid that I might finish last I hugged the curve too hard and lost control Oh I never know which way it's going to go  But what a feeling, chasing the sun Living my life like it's shot from a gun Laughing a little bit more with every mile Oh what a freedom racing the wind Dying to know what's around the next bend And smiling as I watch the years roll by I'm learning how to take it day by day on my highway  On my highway I missed some signs And left a damn good love behind I see her in my rearview like a ghost On my highway I've broken down And cried when no one else was around And prayed that God would take my soul Yeah I've paid a lot of heavy tolls You might also like But what a feeling, chasing the sun Living my life like it's shot from a gun Laughing a little bit more with every mile Oh what a freedom racing the wind Dying to know what's around the next bend And smiling as I watch the years roll by I'm learning how to take it day by day on my highway Yeah, yeah What a feeling out on the run Drinking up the rain, soaking up the sun Laughing a little bit more with every mile Oh what a freedom, like a sail in the wind Not looking back, not forgetting where I've been Smiling as I watch the years roll by And I'm moving on from my mistakes And I'm learning how to take it day by day on my highway  Oh oh, yeahEmbed	8	1
222	This life is full of choices Hard to make one All the voices in my head Those blue eyes I'm in love with Or that highway whichever I pick There'll be regrets I go one way I lose everything I go the other way same thing  I'm torn and it's tearing me apart I want to go but I don't want to break her heart Like a sword with a double edged blade It's going to cut deep either way This little town (this little town), that big old world (that big old world) Chase the dream or keep the girl  More than once I packed it all up (break down) But I break down blame it on the truck Just couldn't go (just couldn't) Just want to be out there making my mark Lay down every night in her arms  I'm torn and it's tearing me apart I want to go but I don't want to break her heart Like a sword with a double edged blade It's going to cut deep either way This little town (this little town), that big old world (that big old world) Chase the dream or keep the girl You might also like I don't know why I can't have it all Need to tear down that wall Between this little town, that big old world Go chase my dream and keep the girl  I'm torn and it's tearing me apart I want to go but I don't want to break her heart Like a sword with a double edged blade It's going to cut deep either way This little town (this little town), that big old world (that big old world) Chase the dream or keep the girl  I want it all, keep the girl, heyEmbed	8	1

[Intro] Whoa, welcome to a day of my life, day of my life The memoirs of an imperfect angel Whoa, welcome, welcome, welcome to a day of my life The memoirs of an imperfect angel [Verse ] Though the lights were low I could see you both in a lover's silhouette And my heart stood still, I was froze right there Staring down at her red dress So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are Rolled down all the windows just so I could breathe Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara runnin' Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny Been too good to you, I've been virtuous and true To have something like this happen in my own bedroom [Chorus] Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When I get you back) Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When your heart's been cracked) Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When we fade to black) How it feels for real [Post-Chorus] And you see your whole world collapse And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh right in your face, boy Betcha gon' know though how it feels [Verse ] So I pulled to the side of the road to fix my face But I can't cover with make up what my tears want to erase I wake up in a haze, morning dew and sun rays As I drive, I hide my eyes behind my black Cavalli Shades A block from the house slowly creep in the driveway Tip toe through the door, but you're there wide awake You're like: "Where you been?" I'm like: "Sorry, but I fell asleep on Jasmine's sofa I could've swore that Rae Rae called you and told ya" You're like: "You okay?" I'm like: "I'm alright, little sleep and I'll be fine." But if you only knew what was in the back of my mind Already stung, but you really gon' find out in time [Chorus] Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When I get you back) Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When your heart's been cracked) Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When we fade to black) How it feels for real [Bridge] This is for real, for real, for real Oprah Winfrey, whole segment, for real, for real /, Barbara Walters, for real, for real Minutes, for real [Outro] Baby, I had all my trust in you And look at what you put me through You got me all crazy Somewhere down the line, you're gon' get what you deserve You fucking jerk You were supposed to save me, my sweet baby Now we're fading away But your gonna know how this feels Even if it's the last thing I ever do To be continuedEmbed	0

On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure This is my first and only self-portrait I drew it when I was / and entitled it "Me. I Am Mariah." Please don't judge me for such a simplistic title... C'mon!! I was only / haha It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself With the purity of a child's heart, before it was ever broken I've kept this drawing private for so long But because this album is a reflection Of some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today I've decided to share it with those of you Who actually care and have been here for me through it all Been through a lot, but I've always known Me... I am Mariah Along the way, there have been a couple of nicknames (Mimi) And I've inadvertently embodied many personas (Butterfly) Lately, they've been calling me The Elusive Chanteuse (I like it) Embed	0

Como un libro Que no sabes el final Y te asusta lo que lees Asi la vida es Cuando naces Ya te expones al dolor Y de a poco y con valor Logras crecer Y como un libro el corazon Nos enseña que hay temor Que hay fracasos y maldad Que hay batallas que ganar Y en cada pagina el amor Nos combierte en luchador Y descubres lo comun No hay un héroe como tu Son muy pocos Que se arriesgan por amor Pero tu tienes la fe Y eso lo es todo No decaigas Que vivir es aprender Y no hay nada que temer Si crees en ti Y como un libro el corazon Nos enseña que hay temor Que hay fracasos y maldad Que hay batallas que ganar Y en cada pagina el amor Nos combierte en luchador Y descubres lo comun No hay un héroe como tu Solo Dios Sabe donde y cuando La vida nos dira Lo has echo bien Solo Con un sueño solo Sabras como vencer Y como un libro el corazon Nos enseña que hay temor Que hay fracasos y maldad Que hay batallas que ganar Y en cada pagina el amor Nos combierte en luchador Y descubres lo comun No hay un héroe como tuEmbed	0

I've often wondered if there's ever been a perfect family I've always longed for undividedness and sought stability A flower taught me how to pray But as I grew, that flower changed She started flailing in the wind Like golden petals scattering And I miss you dandelion And even love you And I wish there was a way for me to trust you But it hurts me every time I try to touch you But I miss you dandelion And even love you I gravitated towards a patriarch so young predictably I was resigned to spend my life within a maze of misery A boy and a girl befriended me We're bonded through despondency I stayed so long, but finally I fled to save my sanity And I miss you, little sis And little brother And I hope you realize I'll always love you (I'll always, always love you) And although you're struggling You will recover (You're gonna make it, baby) And I miss you, little sis And little brother (Whoa, oh) So many I considered closest to me Turned on a dime and sold me out dutifully (Sold me, sold me) Although that knife was chipping away at me (Hey) They turned their eyes away and Went home to sleep (Sleep, sleep, sleep) And I missed a lot of life, but I'll recover Though I know you really like to see me suffer (Like to see me suffer) Still, I wish that you and I'd forgive each other (Ooh) 'Cause I miss you, Valentine And really loved you I really loved you (I guess I loved you) I tried so hard But you drove me away To preserve my sanity (Mm) And I found the strength to break away (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do) FlyEmbed	0

She was kind of fragile And she had a lot to grapple with But basically she kept It all inside Childlike and effervescent With a well of pain The depth of I could not imagine If I tried Never thought that I Would hear them say Twister went and threw it all away She was kind of magical Her laughter sent you casually Floating through a moment Of release Dear God, it's all so tragic And I'll never have the chance To feel the closure That I ultimately need No, I never dreamed That there would come a time Twister'd go and leave it all behind Lord I pray she's found some peace And her soul's somewhere at ease Yeah I'm feeling kind of fragile And I've got a lot to handle But I guess this is my way Of saying goodbyeEmbed	0
It's hard to explain Inherently it's just always been strange Neither here nor there Always somewhat out of place everywhere Ambiguous Without a sense of belonging to touch Somewhere halfway Feeling there's no one completely the same Standing alone Eager to just Believe it's good enough to be what You really are But in your heart Uncertainty forever lies And you'll always be Somewhere on the Outside Early on, you face The realization you don't have a space Where you fit in And recognize you Were born to exist Standing alone Eager to just Believe it's good enough to be what You really are But in your heart Uncertainty forever lies And you'll always be Somewhere on the Outside And it's hard And it's hard And it's hard Irreversibly Falling in between And it's hard And it's hard To be understood As you are As you are Oh, and God knows That you're standing on your own Blind and unguided Into a world divided You're thrown Where you're never quite the same Although you try, try, and try To tell yourself You really are But in your heart - uncertainty forever lies And you'll always be Somewhere on the outside You'll always be Somewhere on the outsideEmbed	0

My dearest, I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately. I've read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture, and getting more homesick every minute. I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of except, of course, you yourself. I keep thinking of you, darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worse possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don't look so good in that subject. This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess. I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you, darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won't be too much longer until I'm able to be with you again and live a sane and normal life.Embed	5

Remembering how she laughed at Kinko's When I made fun of that guy Remembering the look she gave me When I told her that I used to fry I really want to ask her out But my ego could never take it And even if I got the balls You know that the Cougar would never make it Ah-ah-ah And in my town you can't drive naked You might also like Maybe I'd impress her by being in a band and Maybe if I act real tough, she'd let me hold her hand and Maybe I'll win her heart by writing this song about her Sometimes I sit at home and Wonder if she's sitting at home Thinking of me and wondering if I'm Sitting at home, thinking about her Or am I just wasting my time? Am I just wasting my time? Am I just wasting my time? Am I just wasting my time? Wasting my time thinking about a girl Should we double 'em high or low?Embed	5

I'm not saying I have all the answers And I don't care who's right or wrong I'm trying to pick up the pieces already fallen And put them back where they belong So slow down your horses Stop dragging me around And if crying is the only way into your heart Then leaving is the only way out We've slammed every door in anger And we've opened wounds we can't mend And one night lonely is one night too many Don't wanna wake up to one more night that won't end So slow down your horses Stop dragging love around And if crying is the only way into your heart Then leaving is the only way out When late nights and long lies came knocking You just invited them in And our voices got too loud for talking Then my heart hit the floor But your feet just kept walking And if crying is the only way you hear me hurting For the loving that I can't live without And if loving ain't the only way into your heart Then leaving is the only way out Oh, leaving is the only way outEmbed	6

Remember me, the way I was The way I'd make you late for work I had to hold you, just because Remember you, the way you'd wake me up To love me once again We were lovers, we were friends But was I chasing rainbows Blinded by the sun And did I take for granted I'd be the only one? I didn't know you were so lonely Am I to blame for making you that way? Did I neglect all that mattered? With my head so far above The clouds I didn't see That it was raining on our love Remember when, just to feel my touch Was all you ever needed Oh, it used to be enough Remember when love Was a promise we would give our lives to keep And no river ran as deep But was I chasing rainbows Blinded by the sun And did I take for granted I'd be the only one? I didn't know you were so lonely Am I to blame for making you that way? Did I neglect all that mattered? With my head so far above The clouds I didn't see That it was raining on our love I was taking all the love you had to give But I was too lost in life to know That without my love in return you could not live Now she gives the love I did not show I didn't know you were so lonely Am I to blame for making you that way? Did I neglect all that mattered? With my head so far above The clouds I didn't see That it was raining on our loveEmbed	6

And who's gonna stop the world When living is no more fun? When will you wake up From all of the dreams that you make up And who's gonna be your girl tonight?Embed	6

January's always bitter But, Lord, this one beats all The wind ain't quit for weeks now And the drifts are ten feet tall I've been all night drivin' heifers Closer in to lower ground Then I spent the mornin' thinkin' About the ones the wolves pulled down Charlie Barton and his family Stopped today to say goodbye He said the bank was takin' over The last few years were just too dry And I promised that I'd visit When they found a place in town Then I spent a long time thinkin' About the ones the wolves pulled down Lord, please shine, a light of hope On those of us who fall behind And when we stumble in the snow Could You help us up, while there's still time? Well, I don't mean to be complainin', Lord You've always seen me through And I know You got Your reasons For each and every thing you do But tonight outside my window There's a lonesome, mournful sound And I just can't keep from thinkin' About the ones the wolves pulled down Oh, Lord, keep me from bein' The one the wolves pulled downEmbed	7
Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls Every light is burnin' in a house across town She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rolls She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rolls She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again" 'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rollsEmbed	7
We call them cool Those hearts that have no scars to show The ones that never do let go And risk the tables being turned We call them fools Who have to dance within the flame Who chance the sorrow and the shame That always comes with getting burned But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire 'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire We call them strong Those who can face this world alone Who seem to get by on their own Those who will never take the fall We call them weak Who are unable to resist The slightest chance love might exist And for that forsake it all They're so hell-bent on giving, walking a wire Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul Constantly yearning to get out of control Wanting to fly higher and higher I can't abide standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fireEmbed	7

Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence Over Belleau Wood that night For a Christmas truce had been declared By both sides of the fight As we lay there in our trenches The silence broke in two By a German soldier singing A song that we all knew Though I did not know the language The song was "Silent Night" Then I heard my buddy whisper "All is calm and all is bright" Then the fear and doubt surrounded me Because I'd die if I was wrong But I stood up in my trench And I began to sing along Then across the frozen battlefield Another's voice joined in Until one by one each man became A singer of the hymn Then I thought that I was dreaming For right there in my sight Stood the German soldier 'Neath the falling flakes of white And he raised his hand and smiled at me As if he seemed to say "Here's hoping we both live to see us Find a better way" Then the devil's clock struck midnight And the skies lit up again And the battlefield where heaven stood Was blown to hell again But for just one fleeting moment The answer seemed so clear Heaven's not beyond the clouds It's just beyond the fear No, heaven's not beyond the clouds It's for us, to find it, hereEmbed	7

We call them cool Those hearts that have no scars to show The ones that never do let go And risk the tables being turned We call them fools Who have to dance within the flame Who chance the sorrow and the shame That always comes with getting burned But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire 'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire We call them strong Those who can face this world alone Who seem to get by on their own Those who will never take the fall We call them weak Who are unable to resist The slightest chance love might exist And for that forsake it all They're so hell-bent on giving, walking a wire Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul Constantly yearning to get out of control Wanting to fly higher and higher I can't abide standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fireEmbed	7

Well, I don't mean to be complainin', Lord You've always seen me through And I know You got Your reasons For each and every thing you do But tonight outside my window There's a lonesome, mournful sound And I just can't keep from thinkin' About the ones the wolves pulled down Oh, Lord, keep me from bein' The one the wolves pulled downEmbed	7
Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls Every light is burnin' in a house across town She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rolls She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rolls She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again" 'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rollsEmbed	7
We call them cool Those hearts that have no scars to show The ones that never do let go And risk the tables being turned We call them fools Who have to dance within the flame Who chance the sorrow and the shame That always comes with getting burned But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire 'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire We call them strong Those who can face this world alone Who seem to get by on their own Those who will never take the fall We call them weak Who are unable to resist The slightest chance love might exist And for that forsake it all They're so hell-bent on giving, walking a wire Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul Constantly yearning to get out of control Wanting to fly higher and higher I can't abide standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fireEmbed	7

Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence Over Belleau Wood that night For a Christmas truce had been declared By both sides of the fight As we lay there in our trenches The silence broke in two By a German soldier singing A song that we all knew Though I did not know the language The song was "Silent Night" Then I heard my buddy whisper "All is calm and all is bright" Then the fear and doubt surrounded me Because I'd die if I was wrong But I stood up in my trench And I began to sing along Then across the frozen battlefield Another's voice joined in Until one by one each man became A singer of the hymn Then I thought that I was dreaming For right there in my sight Stood the German soldier 'Neath the falling flakes of white And he raised his hand and smiled at me As if he seemed to say "Here's hoping we both live to see us Find a better way" Then the devil's clock struck midnight And the skies lit up again And the battlefield where heaven stood Was blown to hell again But for just one fleeting moment The answer seemed so clear Heaven's not beyond the clouds It's just beyond the fear No, heaven's not beyond the clouds It's for us, to find it, hereEmbed	7

Take me back to the Green River Let my troubles roll on down Take me when the leaves are falling That's when my baby's love was still around My memories take me to the Green River How plain was the picture in my mind Autumn leaves were paint in the water Love was shining in your eyes Take me back to the Green River Let my troubles roll on down Take me when the leaves are falling That's when my baby's love was still around How I long for us to return To the love we had back then Darling, I'll be waiting a lifetime For you to take me back again Take me back to the Green River Let my troubles roll on down Take me when the leaves are falling That's when my baby's love was still around You might also like How I miss the sound of the water Gently flowing past the trees How I miss your tender kisses The way you once loved me Take me back to the Green River Let my troubles roll on down Take me when the leaves are falling That's when my baby's love was still around How I long for us to return To the love we had back then Darling, I'll be waiting a lifetime For you to take me back again Take me back to the Green River Let my troubles roll on down Take me when the leaves are falling That's when my baby's love was still aroundEmbed	8

(Recitation) Once in Persia reigned a king who upon his royal ring carved these words so true and wise Which when held before his eyes gave him counsel at a glance of his life of changing chance Solemn words and these are they: "Even this shall pass away" Trains of camels through the sand brought him gems from Samarkand Fleets of galleys through the sea brought him pearls to match with thee But he counted not his gain nor his treasure, mine or main "What is wealth ?", the king would say, "Even this shall pass away" In the revel of his court, at the zenith of his sport When the palms of all his guests burned with clapping at his zest He among his figs and wine would cry, "Oh, loving friends of mine Pleasures may come, but they cannot stay, like even this shall pass away ?" The most beautiful woman ever seen was the bride he chose his queen Pillowed on their royal bed, whispering to her soul he said: "Though a bridegroom never pressed dearer bosom to his chest But mortal flesh must come to clay and even these shall pass away" Towering over the village square, thirty meters in the air Rose his statue, carved in stone, as the king stood there alone Gazing at his sculptured name, said to himself, "So what is fame ? Fame, it's but slow decay, even this shall pass away" Fighting furiously on a battlefield, once a javelin pierced his shield Soldiers with a loud lament bore him bleeding to his tent Groaning from his tortured side, "Pain is hard to bear", he cried "Oh, but with patience day by day, even this shall pass away" You might also likeSick and sore with cancer; weak and tired and old, just minutes yet to go to pass the gates o' gold Spake he with his dying breath, "Life is done, so what is death ?"

He was just an old country doctor in a little country town Fame and fortune had passed him by, though we never saw him frown As day by day in his kindly way, he'd serve us one and all Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he would receive a fee He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he He had to sell his furniture, couldn't pay his office rent So to a dusty room over a livery stable, Doc Brown and his satchel went And on the hitching post at the curb below to advertise his wares He nailed a little sign that read "Doc Brown has moved upstairs" One day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door Old Doc Brown was lying down, but his soul was no more They found him there in that old black suit, on his face was a smile of content But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull Beside each debtor's name old Doc had writ these words "Paid In Full" Old Doc should've had a funeral fine enough for a king It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing 'Cept Jones the undertaker, he did mighty well Donating an old iron casket he had never been able to sell You might also like And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and style But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one Because he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed his sign We'd painted it white and to all of us, it certainly did look fine Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint There aren't nothing left but Doc's own sign and that's getting pretty faint But you can still see that old hitching post, as if an answer to our prayers Mutely tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairsEmbed	6

While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creek bed Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust I'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trustYou might also likeEmbed	6

Sequoyah's winters were sixteen Silent tongue, spirit clean He walked at his father's side Across the smoking battle ground Where red and white men lay all around So many here had died The wind had scattered around Snow white leaves upon the ground Not leaves like leaves from trees Sequoyah said, "What can this be? What's this strange thing here I see? From where come leaves like these?" Sequoyah turned to his father's eyes And he said, "Father you're wise From where come such snow white leaves?" "With such strange marks upon these squares Not even the wise owl could put them there So strange these snow white leaves."

"They see these marks, and they understand The truth in the heart of the far off man The enemies can't hear them." Said Sequoyah's father, "Son, they weave bad medicine on these talking leaves Leave such things to them" Then Sequoyah walking lightly Followed his father quietly But so amazed was he If the white man talks on leaves Why not the Cherokee Banished from his father's face Sequoyah went from place to place But he could not forget Year after year he worked on and on 'Til finally he cut into stone The Cherokee alphabet Sequoyah's hair by now was white His eyes began to lose their light But he taught all who would believe That the Indian's thoughts could be written down Just as the white man's there on the ground And he left us these talking leavesEmbed	6

(Intro) . I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me There were tears on the mail Mother wrote me in jail, but I'm free from the chain gang now . Back home, I was known and respected. Then, one day, I was wrongly suspected. So, they put me in chains in a cold, freezin' rain. But I'm free from the chain gang now . All the years I was known by a number. How I kept my mind is a wonder. And the bare prison cell that was one step from Hell. But I'm free from the chain gang now . I pray that the gossip will spare me when I return to the one I will marry. Like a bird in a tree, I got my liberty. And I'm free from the chain gang nowYou might also likeEmbed	6

His deeds were never published for the public The things he did were never done for show His name was never printed in the paper Until about two days ago He only filed a short form for his taxes No one asked him how he felt about the war He always had a good word for his neighbor Now his good words won't be heard anymore And through the rain I heard the choir singing "Nearer my God to Thee" Through the mist I saw some children crying And I felt nearer my God to Thee His table was never full of plenty His silverware was never the real thing But the tears on the faces of his family Were just as real as if he were a king The preacher said he'd always been a good man But preachers love to throw that phrase around But the tears I tasted gave his words new meaning Watching old friends putting daddy in the ground And through the rain I heard the choir singing "Nearer my God to Thee" Through the mist I saw some children crying And I felt nearer my God to Thee "Nearer my God to Thee"You might also likeEmbed	6

John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon Wearing dirty work clothes, so everyone presumed He was just another logger from the logging camp nearby And he was, but there was something different in John Daniel's eyes John Daniel was a young man, not more than twenty-four And there was an air about him that one could not ignore And in spite of callused hands & dirty clothes, his face was kind And I wanted so to know what was in John Daniel's mind John Daniel, tell me where did you come from? Tell me where is it you've been? John Daniel, tell me why are you different From all of these other men? John Daniel, there's something about you That I don't quite understand John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan? I rented him a room, he went upstairs like all the rest It was Saturday and he'd be going into town, I guessed But he left in a robe and sandals, with a Bible in his hand And I thought to myself, John Daniel, I don't understand You might also like I'd planned to meet some friends of mine when I got off at three In the park we often gathered to talk of love and peace When I got there I found that a crowd had gathered 'round And there I saw John Daniel a sitting on the ground John Daniel, tell me where did you come from? Tell me where is it you've been? John Daniel, tell me why are you different From all of these other men? John Daniel, there's something about you That I don't quite understand John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan? So, "You want to be free," he said, "Well, this is how you can." As he read from the Bible he held in his hand We were searching for the truth, not knowing where to look Not knowing that the answers all were in John Daniel's book John Daniel told us all how we could be free John Daniel taught us all a better way for you and me He came to us in our own way so we'd be sure to see He had the light and essence of the man from Galilee John Daniel, tell me where did you come from?

I've been walkin' these streets so long Singin' the same old song I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks Of Broadway Where hustle's the name of the game And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain There's been a load of compromisin' On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Like a rhinestone cowboy Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phone Well, I don't really mind the rain And a smile can hide all the pain But you're down when you're ridin' the train That's takin' the long way And I dream of the things I'll do With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe There'll be a load of compromisin' On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me You might also likeLike a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Rhinestone cowboy Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phone Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Like a rhinestone cowboy Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know Like a rhinestone cowboyEmbed	8
In the eyes of the old ones Who watched from a distance It was a devilish magic at best But the hearts of the children Were filled with excitement As they dreamed of their house in the West Oh the engine would fire the black smoke would rise Thru the spray of the slick silver steam It was something of wonder that steel plated thunder That moved the American dream That moved the American dream I can hear the sleepy whistle blowin' I can see the spark beneath the wheels As the leaves the hills behind her For the ragged cotton fields In a dusty one-house station All the children grow impatient As they stare into the distance for a sign Here she comes can't you hear her whistle whine Here she comes rollin' in my bloodline Running' in my bloodline Old man Grady waves his lantern You might also like"All on board" I hear him cry While Lucius stokes the cinder And wipes the coal dust from his eyes Yes she was proud and full of fire As she road that silver wire From the Kansas Plains to the great Sierra Pine Here she comes can't you hear the whistle whine Here she comes rollin' in right on time I can feel her she's runnin' in my bloodline Runnin' in my bloodline Here she comes Now the stockyards are empty The steel rails are rusted They belong to the wind and the sand But we long will remember The steel and the timber And the pulse that once beat thru this land Oh the engine would fire the black smoke would rise Thru the spray of the slick silver steam It was something of wonder that steel plated thunder That moved the American dream That moved the American dream The American dream DreamEmbed	8
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes When you take you got to give so live and let live or let go I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden I could promise you things like big diamond rings But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover so you better think it over When it's sweet talking you could make it come true I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it matter So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy Come along and share the good times while we can I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden Along with the sunshine girl there's gotta be a little rain sometimes I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go But there's one thing I want you to know You better look before you leap still water runs deep And there won't always be someone there to pull you out And you know what I'm talking about So smile for a while...You might also likeEmbed	8

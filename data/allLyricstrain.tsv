Sun Gods crest upon his azure shield Shows you what you know ain’t what you feel Shooting beam, blinding me The sun is a giant spaceship tangerine It shoots out rays of hopeful golden morphine Tangerine shooting beam Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Tangerine shooting beam As I stand before this holy sphere It’s singing me a song I don’t want to hear Want to hear Uh huh, yeah, yeah, woah All I see is warm champagne Confetti on the floor from last night, still laying The same playlist on my phone, still playing as my eyes strain Jealous of the sun, wishing I could do the same Man, but how I’m supposed rise though when shit just hold me down? How I'm supposed to shine man, through all the smoke and clouds? I’m on a trip, no luggage, no ticket I’m looking in the mirror and I’m the only thing missing I been tryna find myself, I feel so long distance Made a promise to myself, I wouldn't just be a statistic No, no, I’m the one of the one on one’s Twenty some but my soul a hundred some My mind’s racing, it’s racing And honestly I can’t remember what it’s running from I just hope that I come in one Seems like everyone I know is getting married Everyone else getting buried Life should come with a sign saying "results may vary” Straight up I take my place along the memory The sun’s so high, it’s rising in the heat Try to fight the sunrise but it comes for you Love is brighter than the fiery violent truth	0
The first impulse to violence is probably right The second impulse to stop it is probably wrong Why do people only show forgiveness when they want to sound cool in a song? So I keep tryin' to understand where we are goin' I keep searchin' for some meanin' in my dreams And I'm dreamin' of bein' eaten by a tiger While the sparrows start to sing in a tree And we always end up singin' the same song They remind us of the cool shit in the world But they also remind us we are dying That's why we want to sing even more I don't think we got where we were goin' I had a dream that we were in a weird sky Why do people let their dreams be somethin' so bad? Such a weird fuckin' dream Flyin' around into the sky, like superman Changing tigers and your arrows land sparrows Those religious fucks will never understand And we always end up singin' the same song They remind us of the cool shit in the world Maybe it wasn't really a dream I can't really tell anymore And we always end up singin' the same song 'Cause we always end up singin' the same song Helps us to forget that we were wrong And we always end up singin' the same song And we always end up singin' the same song Helps us to forget that we were wrong	0
Eyes are strange They say everything While our mouths They just try to sing Singing something I can never fall forever and ever So I try to understand it all, but I fail to live it up I'm still standing here forever without sunshine in my mind Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar There's some kind of love that's so much higher Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar I've seen death, I’ve seen truth I've heard lies, I've seen birth too I've seen happiness, I've seen pain And I've seen the sun come up and I've kissed the moon I’ve heard voices through the wall I've seen figures in my bed I feel protected by things I don't understand And that's more than you could say Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar There's some kind of love that's so much higher Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar	0
We all walk around and waste life It's just gonna go on forever Like there's some eternal endless supply of what it takes to keep us alive There might be a day when everything goes away To remind us how ungrateful our culture is We need to take time to replace what's stolen from Mother Nature We only have sun, moon me, you And we only have a little time to show how much we love The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon) How much I really love you And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time) I once heard Grace Jones say I have my own concept of time I always think 'bout that 'cause I've always felt like I was running a little behind But what's in front of me?

How can I love someone I never touched? You lived under the water, but I love you so much You never been on land, and you never seen the sky You don't know what a cloud is Why does everything I love have to die? They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be But I couldn't let that be Thought keeping you small, meant keeping you safe If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea 'Cause I can't bear to see something so wild just die in a tank And Pablow the blowfish I miss you so much And Pablow the blowfish I miss you so bad On Saturday night, we all went out to eat But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi I got soup, and I ordered rice But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite Oh, Pablow the blowfish If they only knew you like I do They'd love you too And Pablow the blowfish I miss you so bad I won't forget, even one second we had 'Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead I heard of a seahorse named Sadie I heard she was quite the lady Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies That'd be kind of crazy If Pablow the blowfish Found love deep in the sea Then that would mean Pablow the blowfish Is better off than here with me But Pablow the blowfish I miss you so bad Damn	0

Here's something I've learned about people. We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip. This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you. The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'. When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right? Let me say it again, louder for those in the back... We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us. There will be no further explanation There will be just reputation.See ,	1

[Intro] Whoa, welcome to a day of my life, day of my life The memoirs of an imperfect angel Whoa, welcome, welcome, welcome to a day of my life The memoirs of an imperfect angel [Verse ] Though the lights were low I could see you both in a lover's silhouette And my heart stood still, I was froze right there Staring down at her red dress So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are Rolled down all the windows just so I could breathe Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara runnin' Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny Been too good to you, I've been virtuous and true To have something like this happen in my own bedroom [Chorus] Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When I get you back) Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When your heart's been cracked) Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When we fade to black) How it feels for real [Post-Chorus] And you see your whole world collapse And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh right in your face, boy Betcha gon' know though how it feels [Verse ] So I pulled to the side of the road to fix my face But I can't cover with make up what my tears want to erase I wake up in a haze, morning dew and sun rays As I drive, I hide my eyes behind my black Cavalli Shades A block from the house slowly creep in the driveway Tip toe through the door, but you're there wide awake You're like: "Where you been?" I'm like: "Sorry, but I fell asleep on Jasmine's sofa I could've swore that Rae Rae called you and told ya" You're like: "You okay?" I'm like: "I'm alright, little sleep and I'll be fine." But if you only knew what was in the back of my mind Already stung, but you really gon' find out in time [Chorus] Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When I get you back) Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When your heart's been cracked) Betcha gon' know though how it feels (When we fade to black) How it feels for real [Bridge] This is for real, for real, for real Oprah Winfrey, whole segment, for real, for real /, Barbara Walters, for real, for real Minutes, for real [Outro] Baby, I had all my trust in you And look at what you put me through You got me all crazy Somewhere down the line, you're gon' get what you deserve You fucking jerk You were supposed to save me, my sweet baby Now we're fading away But your gonna know how this feels Even if it's the last thing I ever do To be continuedEmbed	3

On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure This is my first and only self-portrait I drew it when I was / and entitled it "Me. I Am Mariah." Please don't judge me for such a simplistic title... C'mon!! I was only / haha It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself With the purity of a child's heart, before it was ever broken I've kept this drawing private for so long But because this album is a reflection Of some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today I've decided to share it with those of you Who actually care and have been here for me through it all Been through a lot, but I've always known Me... I am Mariah Along the way, there have been a couple of nicknames (Mimi) And I've inadvertently embodied many personas (Butterfly) Lately, they've been calling me The Elusive Chanteuse (I like it) Embed	3

Reflections of your love Have come to wither I thought I'd done my best to memorize A picture fades of you and I together I haven't come to terms With how we said goodbye Did you really care Care at all for me? Did you really care? Did you care at all for me? A displaced little girl Wept years in silence And whispered wishes you'd materialize She pressed on night and day To keep on living And tried to many ways To keep her soul alive Did you really care Care enough for me? Did you really care? Did you care at all for me?  If I'm not quite good enough Or somehow undeserving of A mother's love You could have had the decency To give me up Before you gave me life Don't you even care Just the slightest bit for me? 'Cause I really need to feel you cared Even once upon a time for me I need to believe, in my heart of heart of hearts, you care for me I need to understand Why you left me there so helplessly Don't you even care Care at all for me?

It's hard to explain Inherently it's just always been strange Neither here nor there Always somewhat out of place everywhere Ambiguous Without a sense of belonging to touch Somewhere halfway Feeling there's no one completely the same Standing alone Eager to just Believe it's good enough to be what You really are But in your heart Uncertainty forever lies And you'll always be Somewhere on the Outside Early on, you face The realization you don't have a space Where you fit in And recognize you Were born to exist  Standing alone Eager to just Believe it's good enough to be what You really are But in your heart Uncertainty forever lies And you'll always be Somewhere on the Outside And it's hard And it's hard And it's hard Irreversibly Falling in between And it's hard And it's hard To be understood As you are As you are Oh, and God knows That you're standing on your own Blind and unguided Into a world divided You're thrown Where you're never quite the same Although you try, try, and try To tell yourself You really are But in your heart - uncertainty forever lies And you'll always be Somewhere on the outside You'll always be Somewhere on the outsideEmbed	3

[Intro] Mm [Verse ] Once upon a time there was a girl In her early years she had to learn How to grow up living in a war that she called home Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face Every time my father's fist would put her in her place Hearing all the yelling, I would cry up in my room Hoping it would be over soon [Chorus] Bruises fade, Father, but the pain remains the same And I still remember how you kept me so afraid Strength is my mother for all the love she gave Every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday And I'm OK [Verse ] I often wonder why I carry all this guilt When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door The echo of a broken child screaming, "Please, no more" Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done? To you, it's just a memory, but for me, it still lives on [Chorus] Bruises fade, Father, but the pain remains the same And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid Strength is my mother for all the love she gave Every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday [Bridge] It's not so easy to forget All the marks you left along her neck When I was thrown against cold stairs And every day, I'm afraid to come home In fear of what I might see next [Chorus] Bruises fade, Father, but the pain remains the same (Same) And I still remember how you kept me so afraid Strength is my mother for all the love you gave Every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday And I'm OK I'm OKEmbed	4

(Recitation) Once in Persia reigned a king who upon his royal ring carved these words so true and wise Which when held before his eyes gave him counsel at a glance of his life of changing chance Solemn words and these are they: "Even this shall pass away" Trains of camels through the sand brought him gems from Samarkand Fleets of galleys through the sea brought him pearls to match with thee But he counted not his gain nor his treasure, mine or main "What is wealth ?", the king would say, "Even this shall pass away" In the revel of his court, at the zenith of his sport When the palms of all his guests burned with clapping at his zest He among his figs and wine would cry, "Oh, loving friends of mine Pleasures may come, but they cannot stay, like even this shall pass away ?" The most beautiful woman ever seen was the bride he chose his queen Pillowed on their royal bed, whispering to her soul he said: "Though a bridegroom never pressed dearer bosom to his chest But mortal flesh must come to clay and even these shall pass away" Towering over the village square, thirty meters in the air Rose his statue, carved in stone, as the king stood there alone Gazing at his sculptured name, said to himself, "So what is fame ? Fame, it's but slow decay, even this shall pass away" Fighting furiously on a battlefield, once a javelin pierced his shield Soldiers with a loud lament bore him bleeding to his tent Groaning from his tortured side, "Pain is hard to bear", he cried "Oh, but with patience day by day, even this shall pass away" You might also likeSick and sore with cancer; weak and tired and old, just minutes yet to go to pass the gates o' gold Spake he with his dying breath, "Life is done, so what is death ?"

My dearest, I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately. I've read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture, and getting more homesick every minute. I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of except, of course, you yourself. I keep thinking of you, darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worse possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don't look so good in that subject. This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess. I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you, darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won't be too much longer until I'm able to be with you again and live a sane and normal life.Embed	14

(Intro) . I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me There were tears on the mail Mother wrote me in jail, but I'm free from the chain gang now . Back home, I was known and respected. Then, one day, I was wrongly suspected. So, they put me in chains in a cold, freezin' rain. But I'm free from the chain gang now . All the years I was known by a number. How I kept my mind is a wonder. And the bare prison cell that was one step from Hell. But I'm free from the chain gang now . I pray that the gossip will spare me when I return to the one I will marry. Like a bird in a tree, I got my liberty. And I'm free from the chain gang nowYou might also likeEmbed	18

His deeds were never published for the public The things he did were never done for show His name was never printed in the paper Until about two days ago He only filed a short form for his taxes No one asked him how he felt about the war He always had a good word for his neighbor Now his good words won't be heard anymore And through the rain I heard the choir singing "Nearer my God to Thee" Through the mist I saw some children crying And I felt nearer my God to Thee His table was never full of plenty His silverware was never the real thing But the tears on the faces of his family Were just as real as if he were a king The preacher said he'd always been a good man But preachers love to throw that phrase around But the tears I tasted gave his words new meaning Watching old friends putting daddy in the ground And through the rain I heard the choir singing "Nearer my God to Thee" Through the mist I saw some children crying And I felt nearer my God to Thee "Nearer my God to Thee"You might also likeEmbed	18

The hills were alive with wildflowers And I was as wild, even wilder than they For at least I could run, they just died in the sun And I refused to just wither in place Just a wild mountain rose needing freedom to grow So I ran fearing not where I'd go When a flower grows wild, it can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they grow And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew Were content to be lost in the crowd They were common and close, I had no room for growth And I wanted so much to branch out So I uprooted myself from my homeground and left Took my dreams and I took to the road When a flower grows wild, it can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they grow I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right In a garden so different from me I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone So the garden, one day, set me free I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend I just let him decide where we'd go When a flower grows wild, it can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they grow You might also likeJust a wild rambling rose seeking mysteries untold No regret for the path that I chose When a flower grows wild, it can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they growEmbed	19

I've been out on this highway of heartache Hoping that somewhere down the line I could find somebody who Could rev me like you do So grab onto my wheel And I'll be fine Take the keys to my heart And drive me crazy I've been running on empty way too long Honey you got the touch That heats my motor up Take the keys to my heart And drive it home Fill her up I don't know where this road is going to lead us But what a beautiful night for a drive Baby put your mind at ease Drop the top and feel the breeze Just follow all the signs to paradise  Take the keys to my heart And drive me crazy I've been running on empty way too long All that work under the hood Sure has got it running good Take the keys to my heart And drive it home Tonight we're going to set these wheels on fire And find out just how far this thing will go Honey we don't need no map Because where we are is where it's at Drop the keys to my heart And drive it home Baby makes my motor yearn I long to feel that rubber burn Take the keys to my heart And drive it home Drive it homeEmbed	22
Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence Over Belleau Wood that night For a Christmas truce had been declared By both sides of the fight As we lay there in our trenches The silence broke in two By a German soldier singing A song that we all knew Though I did not know the language The song was "Silent Night" Then I heard my buddy whisper "All is calm and all is bright" Then the fear and doubt surrounded me Because I'd die if I was wrong But I stood up in my trench And I began to sing along Then across the frozen battlefield Another's voice joined in Until one by one each man became A singer of the hymn  Then I thought that I was dreaming For right there in my sight Stood the German soldier 'Neath the falling flakes of white And he raised his hand and smiled at me As if he seemed to say "Here's hoping we both live to see us Find a better way" Then the devil's clock struck midnight And the skies lit up again And the battlefield where heaven stood Was blown to hell again But for just one fleeting moment The answer seemed so clear Heaven's not beyond the clouds It's just beyond the fear No, heaven's not beyond the clouds It's for us, to find it, hereEmbed	22
